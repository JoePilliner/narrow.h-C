# narrow.h

## specification

narrow.h is a C header file that defines a preprocessor macro ```narrow(type, width)``` for a struct with a member bitfield ```value``` of type ```type``` and width ```width```

## note

this header file is primarily intended to demonstrate that I know how to define a compile-time generic functional type.
